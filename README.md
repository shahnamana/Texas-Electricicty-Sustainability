## Introduction

Texas, known for its vast energy resources, is undergoing a significant transformation in its electricity sector. This project delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar power, and their integration into the existing power grid.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze historical trends in Texas's electricity production and consumption
- Evaluate the current state of renewable energy integration in Texas
- Assess the impact of renewable energy on grid stability and reliability
- Explore potential future scenarios for sustainable electricity production in Texas
- Provide recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders

## Data Sources

Our analysis relies on data from various sources, including:

- Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
- U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
- Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)

## Methodology

We employed a multi-faceted approach to analyze Texas's electricity sustainability:

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Time series analysis of electricity production and consumption
3. Geospatial analysis of renewable energy potential
4. Statistical modeling of grid stability factors
5. Scenario planning for future energy mix projections

## Key Findings

- Renewable energy sources, particularly wind power, have seen significant growth in Texas over the past decade
- Integration of renewables has posed challenges to grid stability, especially during extreme weather events
- Energy storage solutions and grid modernization are crucial for enhancing the reliability of renewable energy
- Texas has substantial untapped potential for solar energy production
- A balanced approach combining renewable and traditional energy sources is essential for long-term sustainability
