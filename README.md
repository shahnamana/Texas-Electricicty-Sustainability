# Texas-Electricicty-Sustainability

Sustainability-focused data system to optimize electricity 

Problem Statement: 
The main sustainability problem that the present project will be focusing on is the heavy reliance on non-renewable sources of energy, which are mainly at the form of fossil fuels, in the generation of electricity in Texas. The tremendous surge in the state's lectricity demand, fueled by the growth of the population, economic growth, and the proliferation of digital technologies, simultaneously provides both a challenge and opportunity for transitioning to a more sustainable energy mix.
